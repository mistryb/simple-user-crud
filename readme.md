# Simple User Crud
## Design Assumptions and Decisions
* No Authentication methods were implemented.
* As minimal information is stored, a separate page dedicated to viewing the user was omitted. Instead all the information for a user can be seen in the list view.
* User Roles cannot be edited, only set when a user is created. As user roles really serve no purpose with the lack of authentication. 

## API Documentation
* `GET` /getUserById 
* `GET` /getAllUsers
* `POST` /createUser
* `POST` /updateUser

### `GET` /getUserById
#### Description
