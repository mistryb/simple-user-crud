# Simple User Crud
## Design Assumptions and Decisions
* No Authentication methods were implemented.
* As minimal information is stored, a separate page dedicated to viewing the user was omitted. Instead all the information for a user can be seen in the list view.
* User Roles cannot be edited, only set when a user is created. As user roles really serve no purpose with the lack of authentication. 

## API Documentation
* `GET` /getUsersById
* `GET` /getAllUsers
* `POST` /createUser
* `POST` /updateUser

## Requirements Provided

Specifications:

Provide an implementation based on the specifications below, using a PHP MVC framework of your choice (Laravel is recommended, but other options are also acceptable)

Using the DB schema specified in the attached .sql file, create a basic web application that includes the following:

A web Front-End that performs CRUD functionality for user objects

RESTful API endpoints that provide CRUD functionality for user objects

Deliverables:

Source code checked into version control, with a link where we can access it.
Documentation outlining the API endpoints and parameters that get passed in. 
Documentation describing any design decisions you made that werenâ€™t straightforward. 
(Documentation can either be in version control or shared separately via email).
