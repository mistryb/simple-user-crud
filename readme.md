# Simple User Crud

## Installation Instructions
1. Pull repository.
2. Update Composer.
3. Install Bower Components in the public directory.
4. Run migrations.
5. Enjoy.

## Design Assumptions and Decisions
* No Authentication methods were implemented.
* As minimal information is stored, a separate page dedicated to viewing the user was omitted. Instead all the information for a user can be seen in the list view.
* User Roles cannot be edited, only set when a user is created. As user roles really serve no purpose with the lack of authentication. 
* Deleting can only be done through the web application to allow for a confirmation prompt before deletion.
